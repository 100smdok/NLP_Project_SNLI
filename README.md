# Natural Language Inference

# Description

The following repository is the codebase for our NLP Project on Natural Language Inference. We have implemented various models to classify the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis into one of three categories: entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

# Code Repository

The code for the project is available on the following link: https://github.com/100smdok/NLP_Project_SNLI

The files are as follows: 

- BERT.ipynb - Implements a BERT classification model on the SNLI dataset
- GRU.ipynb - Implements a GRU classification model on the SNLI dataset
- LSTM.ipynb - Implements an LSTM classification model on the SNLI dataset
- RNN_relu.ipynb - Implements an RNN classification model (activation is relu) on the SNLI dataset
- RNN_sigmoid.ipynb - Implements an RNN classification model (activation is sigmoid) on the SNLI dataset
- RNN_softmax.ipynb - Implements an RNN classification model (activation is softmax) on the SNLI dataset

# How To Run?

Download the dataset from the above link and change the dataset's location in the following notebooks and hit *RUN!!*

Each notebook will produce checkpoints, final models, Classification Reports, and a Confusion Matrix Plot.
